\section{Advantages of Java}\label{L:Why:Adv}
Traditionally, programming languages used for microcontroller applications development have always been C or assembler. In terms of user application development, assembler required a high level of programming and memory management knowledge if a complex application is required to implement. This complexity can be decreased by using C language for these purposes, but a insufficient knowledge of it can result on bigger problems in applications developed for these kind of devices.

In the other hand, these languages do not offer the possibility to create an application interoperable in different platforms, they do not allow portability. Java is the most famous programming language that provides platform interoperability. In addition, Java is an object-oriented language with the basic features of encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
