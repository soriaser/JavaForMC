\section{Materials and Methods}
During analysis of resisitive methods, it has been used the most precise
components as possible, whithin project possibilties. As the main objective is
to apply the system described in \cite{UncertaintyInResistance} and
\cite{AccuracyAndResolution} in order to compare diferent capture modes and how
programming affects to final accuracy.
